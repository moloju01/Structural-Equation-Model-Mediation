# Structural-Equation-Model-Mediation

**Description:** Simple mediation examining the effect of past failures on final grades and the relationships between past failures and study time; and study time and final grades

**Purpose:** This project was based on a case concerning The Institute for Student Achievement's partnership with schools to help students who are traditionally underserved and underperforming and prepare them for college

**Question:** How does past failure affect final grades? What is the relationship between these two? Does study time mediate this relationship?

**Variables:** 

Independent Variable - Past Failures

Mediating Variable - Study Time

Dependent Variable - Final Grades

**Prediction:** We predicted the effect of Past Failures on Final Grade would be mediated by Study Time such that Past Failures will increase Study Time which will increase Final Grades.

**Results of Mediation:**

Past Failures to Study Time: -0.20

Study Time to Final Grades: 0.20

Total Effect: -2.22*

Indirect: -0.03

Direct PF on FG: -2.18*

**Result Description:** The percentage of past failures significantly predicts final grades negatively, such that as past failures increase by unit, final grades decrease by 2.22. The percentage of past failures predicts study time negatively, such that for every 1 unit increase in past failures, study time decreases by 0.20. Study time, however, has a positive relationship with final grades but does not significantly mediate the negative relationship between past failures and final grade.
